# Top Ten Mac Exclusive Apps


So you have bought a Mac , what can you do to make the most of it ? Well how about using some of its exclusive apps designed from the ground up to run perfectly on a Mac.

Applications made for certain hardware are always optimised to the core &amp; when the developers are the hardware engineers i.e. Apps Made by Apple. They have certain degree of quality which the fragmented Operating system like the Windows &amp; Ubuntu Computer Users could never achieve. These Applications are tailored for optimised battery life , perfect pixel to pixel ratio applications ( supports Retina display ) etc.

We recommend these applications as they give some extra value of owing a Mac rather than just an impressive Hardware. These software lures other non mac users to own a Mac.

The whole list consist of Premium applications which could be helpful in day to day life activities.

Yes Premium comes at a price &amp; all these applications comes at a premium price. Often use the trials of the software &amp; then when you feel the need of the software you could always purchase the license for using it.

We all love applications supported by Mac App Store. The list contains applications which are also Multi platform applications but only under Apple Ecosystem including &quot;iPhone&quot; &amp; &quot;iPad&quot;. We do encourage to at least try any of these applications or even buy the application if you love it.

Disclaimer : Our Ratings for Top Ten applications are not biased or favoured to any specific application. We did not receive any gifts or any money for favouring these applications in the top ten exclusive applications.



## Things

This software is by far the best &quot;To Do list &quot; Application I have ever used.

What makes it different from its competitors is the ability to create projects for tasks.

Also each task can be given any custom tags we want with the day of reminders to be followed with the task.

It works great with importing &quot;Reminder&quot; application reminders into its own list &amp; also supports Siri + Reminder Import to Things.

We have included a number of screenshots so that you could easily determine the real value of this application.

It has application support on iPhone , iPad &amp; Mac OS X.

## Day One

They say you should always keep a log of things or keep a journal of everyday life. Base on that simple fact this application improves it further on your personal diary or journal to a next level.

This application does so many things better than its competitors with features included just for improving the user experience while reading the journal again after some time.

It preserves the nostalgia in a digital form by embedding &quot;Activities , GPS Coordinates locations , Weather of that day , Photos&quot; etc.

It also supports its own Personal cloud platform for publishing personal journals on the internet with just one click.

It is currently supported only on iPhone , iPad &amp; Mac OS X.

The reason why videophile or Video Professionals buy a Mac is to get their hands dirty on its one of industry standard of Video Editing tools available.

## Logic Pro X

If you are in the advent of making digital music , Logic Pro X is by far the most versatile &amp; robust audio creation &amp; editing software out there.

Now I am no judge to making professional audio but the jury is out &amp; it has already been established that &quot;Logic Pro X&quot; is the software to have for making wonderful Audio Creations.

This software also has a hefty price tag of $299 &amp; it also includes various sample audio tracks for making your project sound wonderful.

## Aperture

This software was the De-facto standard for Professional Photographer for after processing of the digital photos. Sadly this application support has been dropped &amp; Apple engineers has supported new Photos Application as Aperture&#39;s successor. Still this application was so intuitive for common users &amp; so powerful for professional users.

It was a great blend of Adobe Photoshop , Lightroom &amp; Simple Google Picasa Photoviewer.

Aperture isn&#39;t available to buy as the whole project is being scrapped &amp; succeeded to Photos for Mac.



## Pixelmator

This application is targeted to the intermediate level of users , with great tools &amp; better UI for na√Øve users. This application ticks all the important requirements.

Recently Pixelmator has been updated to the Version 3 which packs more advancements over the earlier versions of the Applications.

It is even priced right at around $40 , so it doesn&#39;t burn any hole of the consumers compared to the Adobe Photoshop , Lightroom Suites costing 10 equivalent software price.

It also has Automator Scripts for some automation on batch images in Apple &quot;Automator&quot; App

## Fantastical 2

This is also one of the application which has perfectly made keeping track of appointments &amp; calendar events a great task.

Tracking birthdays of friends is also easy , with notes &amp; reminder configurations also available.

This application has two modes of operation in themes &quot;Day mode&quot; (Light Mode) or &quot;Night Mode&quot; (Dark Mode). I personally prefer Dark Mode as it saves a considerable amount of battery when using it for significant amount of time.

## iA Writer

The only minimalistic writer you would ever need.

This is the standard of how the word processors should have been in the first place.

The text editors shouldn&#39;t show all the features on its front page rather it should focus on the writing new content &amp; not distracting the writer.

This application also supports two theme working modes. &quot;Day mode&quot; (Light Mode) or &quot;Night Mode&quot; (Dark Mode). I personally prefer Dark Mode also on iA Writer as it saves a considerable amount of battery when writing articles for an hour or so.
