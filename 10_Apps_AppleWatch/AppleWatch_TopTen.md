# Top Ten Apple Watch Apps.
When Apple released its new product as a smart watch developers & users began to wonder about its use case scenarios in daily life. Over the past few years Apple has truly working towards a common goal of making Apple Watch a great accessory or even a necessity. With inclusion of Cellular in Series 3 opened up enormous potential of truly wireless device.
Watch OS 5 also opens up new possibilities & various API's for audio streaming apps which overall has also driven more apps released specifically for the Watch.


## 10. IFTTT 
This app is a must have for users who like Automation of any sort in their life. With Widgets accessible on your wrist is totally overkill or is it ? With just a tap on your hand you can control your applets. For eg. I have a wireless Dlink Power Switch hooked up with IFTTT Service. So with just 1 click I can turn ON/OFF my TV. If I forget to Power Off my TV when I'm away from home.
We could also setup Siri Shortcuts / Workflow coupled with Apple Homekit but we would need compatible hardware which is why IFTTT comes in handy.


## 9. Auto Sleep
Would you like to have sleep tracker with Apple Watch ? You're in luck. Auto sleep does exactly what a sleep tracker does coupled with detailed graphs & stats which helps you to work on your sleep cycles. The app has support for Series 4 Infograph complications which helps to use its manual "Lights Off" option while hitting the hay.
## 8. Nano
When you eat , sleep - Reddit : Repeat. You clearly have an addiction but don't worry we have an app to further increase your addiction 🤪. The app is free to use & has an in-app purchase for unlocking Pro version. I would soon buy its pro version but currently the app suffices my needs of checking Reddit Front page. Also the developer released a new update comprising of various new features & fixes.
## 7. Soundcloud
Identification of songs on your wrist 🤩 We are living in 2018. Let's get everything on our Wrist or Lens. Also it shows the lyrics of the song, Did I mention it is all on your wrist ? All the while being totally free.
## 6. Fantastical 2
Displaying all of the events in the calendar app is great for checking your schedule. Also iPhone app auto translates the events automatically while we are typing. Great app ecosystem available on iPhone , Watch & Mac.




## 5. Streaks 
Need to improve your health or want to track streaks in your life. This app works great with Apple watch for tracking 12 streaks at a time. It has Series 4 complications for Infograph View which gives whole overview of the streaks.


## 4. Things 3
My To Do app for past 5 years, No complains whatsoever. This app has transformed my life into a more discipline and stay in control lifestyle. It has everything a ToDo app should possess minus shared list & attachments. It has the whole apple ecosystem on iPhone, iPad, Mac & Apple Watch.
Jump from v2 to v3 was paid and no discount/sale was available after the first week of v3 till the time of the article being written. $9.99 (iPhone) , $19.99 (iPad) & $49.99 (Mac) Adds up way fast when you have to upgrade from version 2 to version 3 of the app.


## 3. Water Minder
The most used app on my Apple watch & truly deserving the home screen of the watch complication. With custom liquid sets defined on iPhone makes it easy to log your Water ( liquid ) Intake. Also the reminders on Apple Watch is one of the salient features of this app. Now if only they would remind developers to leave their desk to empty their water intake 🤓
## 2. Spark
Think mails : > Think Spark. Free to use app which is one of the cleanest mail app I have ever used. It is available on Mac, iPhone & Watch. Great Combo everywhere. It has a great user interface for linking mail accounts from Gmail, Outlook & work accounts. The iPhone app also has various services integration options.

## 1. 1Password 

My favourite app on the Watch just due to one big reason - Passwords!
After using so many services human mind in normal state won't be able to remember all of the passwords or details of specific content. 1Password comes to rescue of removing the remembering part & also could recommend us strong passwords. 
Its Auto fill feature also works wonders. Available on iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch & other platforms like Windows & Browsers. Great must have utility app which can be used to save credit cards, wifi passwords, social media credentials etc.




These are my daily must have apps which encourages me to use Apple Watch more & not unlock my iPhone for small tasks. Also health features coupled with ease of use are also selling point of Apple Watch but I would argue its developer supported Apps is one of the killer features of Apple Watch's hefty price tag compared to its competition.
