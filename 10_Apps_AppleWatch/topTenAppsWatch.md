# Top Ten Apple WatchÂ Apps.
When Apple released its new product as smartwatch developers & users began to wonder about its use case scenarios in daily life. Over the past few years, Apple has truly worked towards a common goal of making Apple Watch a great accessory or even a necessity. With the inclusion of Cellular in Series 3 opened up enormous potential of the truly wireless device.
Watch OS 5 also opens up new possibilities & various API for audio streaming apps which overall has also driven more apps released specifically for the Watch.


## 10. IFTTT
This app is a must-have for users who like Automation of any sort in their life. With Widgets accessible on your wrist is totally overkill or is it? With just a tap on your hand, you can control your applets. For eg. I have a wireless Dlink Power Switch hooked up with IFTTT Service. So with just 1 click, I can turn ON/OFF my TV. If I forget to Power Off my TV when I'm away from home.




We could also set up Siri Shortcuts / Workflow coupled with Apple Homekit but we would need compatible hardware which is why IFTTT comes in handy.


## 9. Auto Sleep
Would you like to have sleep tracker with Apple Watch? You're in luck. Auto sleep does exactly what a sleep tracker should do, coupled with detailed graphs & stats which helps you to work on your sleep cycles. The app has support for Series 4 Infograph complications which helps to use its manual "Lights Off" option while hitting the hay.


## 8. Nano
When you eat, sleepâ€Š-â€ŠReddit: Repeat. You clearly have an addiction but don't worry we have an app to further increase your addiction ðŸ¤ª. The app is free to use & has an in-app purchase for unlocking Pro version. I would soon buy its pro version but currently, the app suffices my needs of checking Reddit Frontpage. Also, the developer released a new update comprising of various new features & fixes.


7. Soundcloud
Identification of songs on your wrist ðŸ¤© We are living in 2018. Let's get everything on our Wrist or Lens. Also, it shows the lyrics of the song, Did I mention it is all on your wrist? All the while being totally free.




## 6. Fantastical 2
Displaying all of the events in the calendar app is great for checking your schedule. Also iPhone app auto translates the events automatically while we are typing. Great app ecosystem available on iPhone, Watch & Mac.




## 5. Streaks
Need to improve your health or want to track streaks in your life. This app works great with Apple watch for tracking 12 streaks at a time. It has Series 4 complications for Infograph View which gives the whole overview of the streaks.


## 4. Things 3
My To Do app for past 5 years, No complaints whatsoever. This app has transformed my life into a more discipline and stay in control lifestyle. It has everything a ToDo app should possess minus shared list & attachments. It has the whole Apple ecosystem on iPhone, iPad, Mac & Apple Watch.




Jump from v2 to v3 was paid and no discount/sale was available after the first week of v3 till the time of the article being written. $9.99 (iPhone), $19.99 (iPad) & $49.99 (Mac) Adds up way fast when you have to upgrade from version 2 to version 3 of the app.


## 3. Water Minder
The most used app on my Apple watch & truly deserving the home screen of the watch complication. With custom liquid sets defined on iPhone makes it easy to log your Water ( liquid ) Intake. Also, the reminders on Apple Watch is one of the salient features of this app. Now if only they would remind developers to leave their desk to empty their water intake ðŸ¤“


## 2. Spark
Think mailsÂ : > Think Spark. Free to use app which is one of the cleanest mail apps I have ever used. It is available on Mac, iPhone & Watch. Great Combo everywhere. It has a great user interface for linking mail accounts from Gmail, Outlook & work accounts. The iPhone app also has various services integration options.


## 1. 1Password

My favorite app on the Watch just due to one big reasonâ€Š-â€ŠPasswords!
After using so many online services, the human mind in its normal state won't be able to remember all of the passwords or details of specific content. 1Password comes to the rescue of removing the remembering part & also could recommend us strong passwords.
Its Autofill feature also works wonders. Available on iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch & other platforms like Windows & Browsers. Great must have utility app which can be used to save credit cards, Wifi passwords, social media credentials etc.

## Honorable Mentions

### Spotify

Great app ecosystem across every device, just released their official apple watch app when series 4 launched within 2 weeks. Currently, it has somewhat fewer features compared to its iPhone counterpart. Could be also used as a remote control if you have various other Spotify clients running in the background.

These are my daily must-have apps which encourage me to use Apple Watch more & not unlock my iPhone for small tasks. Also, health features coupled with ease of use are also selling point of Apple Watch but I would argue its developer supported Apps is one of the killer features of Apple Watch's hefty price tag compared to its competition.
