# Save your Eyes in Digital Life!

In 21st century we have been surrounded by screens everywhere & excessive dependency on digital lifestyle could lead to weak eye sight or eye strain. This article would help you to reduce some symptoms related to headache & eye strains.

Dark Mode
Use apps who support Dark Mode extensively if you’re using your phone or laptop at night before bed in poor light conditions.

AMOLED Screens are more beneficial for Dark Mode apps as they would turn only the pixels which needs to be lighten up & others would be off.

“Sync for Reddit” , “ES Explorer Pro” , “Journey”, “SeriesGuide” “Things” “Youtube” are just few of the applications which support dark mode & more apps are increasingly supporting Dark mode out of the box.

Software Developers could benefit with Dark mode if they sip coffee at night & code till they implement a new function. Code Editors & various software tools like “Github”, “Terminal”, “Postman” support Dark mode but they are not turned ON by default. Below are the most used developer friendly apps preference for turning Dark Mode.


Mac OS Mojave also added “Dark Mode” support on most of the OS User Interface which could signal a boost for Dark Mode applications in future.

## Better Sleep Control

Use Sleep tracking apps which could guide you to compensate for your inconsistent sleep cycles. If you don’t pay attention to your sleep cycles it could be a part of bigger health problems mixed with stress & anxiety.

Use apps like “AutoSleep” “Sleep++” or Smart Watches companion apps to track your daily sleep. The cheapest solution would be just get an app which could track your phone usage at night & early morning thus basing off your sleep duration with motion sensors.

The cheapest smart band you could purchase would be Xiaomi Mi Band v2 / v3 which would be about $30 — $45. The companion app is great for deep sleep tracking which would use pulse rate sensor when you’re lying down to determine your deep sleep & normal sleep with awake time too. App Link

## Increase Fluid Intake

The best advice I have followed in my life is to drink lots of fluid. Depending on your age, weight & height you could tinker your water intake. More than average water would always be beneficial for the body to be hydrated.

Apps Recommended : “WaterMinder” $3.99 (iOS & Android) (Mac) Separate purchases required.

It recommends you to drink water every 1–2 hours with notifications on your smartphone, PC or Smart Watch.

Also it syncs with iCloud & HealthKit which makes it easy to have your progress displayed properly. There are even different types of Fluid options & custom shortcuts for quick logging of fluid intake from notifications & Apple Watch.

## Blue Light Filter

Apple has included “Night Shift” by default which could be turned on automatically accounting your geolocation sunrise & sunset times. Before going to sleep, less blue light has helped people sleep better compared to the people who didn’t had any screen gradient or blue light filter.

Before Apple implemented Night Shift there was “F.lux” which has better control & more options overall.

## Website Extension

Dark Reader is an fantastic extension on Google chrome store which converts or alters the website CSS data and applies specific theme of Dark or Light theme of your choice. Dark Theme works wonders on about 80% of the websites & you can whitelist certain websites which you don’t need dark mode.

It has various options for tinkering specific features. Truly an eye saver when it comes to reading articles in dark mode.

Also keep away digital screens about 30 mins before going to bed. Healthy lifestyle goes a long way for better lifestyle & increased productivity.
