Apple Sept 9 iPhone 6s Event Highlights.


Recently Apple unveiled new gizmos at the Apple Special Event September 9, 2015.
It consisted of many new updates to earlier apple products lineup.
Most significant updates were related to iOS devices including iPhone & iPad.
A whole new revolutionary product named as iPad Pro , new iPhone iSight Camera & the slick new generation of Apple TV.
Apple is still strong in regards of innovations & design standards over its competitors.


iPhone 6s & 6s+

Upgrading iPhones every year is a difficult thing to do.As competitors are always upgrading their smartphones to another milestones, it is quite difficult for apple to keep up with the competitions.
Earlier iPhone 6 & 6+ got a screen size bump due to its competitors default screen sizes & as the form factor with screen to size ratio was getting smaller year by year. Switching to a bigger screen & smaller body was inevitable.

Getting to the latest iPhone 6s news, this time around it has some tricks up its sleeve. The best feature would be Force Touch inclusion which was rebranded by Apple for Touch devices as “3D Touch”. As far as I can vouch for built in Force Touch Trackpad in my Macbook Pro , I am pretty sure that iPhone’s 3D Touch would do wonders in communicating specific & precise movements , inputs to the iOS Games & Apps.
With iOS 9 which is built extensively with keeping 3D Touch in mind , the Applications are limitless. Even Developers could use the 3D Touch API for their applications functionality in iOS 9.

Camera Spec Upgrade.
12MP iSight Camera sensor is upgraded after 4 years since iPhone 4s. The Front Camera also got a nice upgrade with 5MP sensor , so now your selfies would even be better than ever. Worth the PC wallpaper resolution. Selfie lovers are gonna love the front facing camera. Live Photos are also welcome feature with working gracefully with 3D Touch.
But the biggest news would be 4K Recording at 30fps. Finally iPhone could shoot 4K. You may think as 4K is just a hype but it ain’t a hype. 4K is the future & having used 4k Smart TV for a year I can personally guarantee you that it is far better than the Retina display which is present in the Macbook Pro.
iMac 5K is out of the league with 4K as it just blows 4K out of the water

Processor Upgrade
Apple A9 Processor is powerful custom designed chip which is third generation of Desktop 64-bit class architecture.
It delivers performance up to 70% improvement over its predecessor on CPU Tasks & 90% improvement on GPU Computations.

iPhone 6s Enclosure also got a small strength upgrade due to the  “Bend-Gate” of the iPhone 6 & 6+. It now includes Materials of Aluminium 7000 series which has more durability & also it is little bit heavier compared to earlier model.


iPad.

iPad Pro
The biggest news of the event was next iteration of iPad which was completely different from earlier segments.
Sporting a 12.9” screen which has higher resolutions than the Macbook Pro display. Apple claims it is the display worth buying for Multimedia experiences. The iPad Pro also has 4 speakers which are controlled independently for immersive experience for the user. 
Accessories include Apple Pencil & Apple iPad Pro keyboard which is inherited from the Microsoft Surface Design keyboards. Surface still lacks the sensitivity of the Stylus which Apple Offers. Apple Pencil is battery operated but it just connects directly to the iPad Pro Lighting connector , so there is no hassle of carrying the charger everywhere you travel.
It houses an A9X processor which delivers lighting fast results as it is approximately 2X times faster than its predecessors performance. Driving a retina resolution which is higher than its previous displays do require a speed boost & efficient power delivery to keep the battery usage to its minimum.

The target audience of the iPad Pro would be Designers, Educational Teaching Medium & Multimedia lovers.
The device is still a bit heavy considering the screen size bump but it feels better when docked with the apple keyboard accessory.
iOS 9 supports true dual pane multi window now , which would be boon for those writers who search information on one side & write on other. Much needed feature on the iPad & with Keyboard accessory, the virtual keyboard wont hog the space of the screen.



Apple TV

Folks were waiting for Apple to announce a much awaited update for the Apple TV. Finally the wait is over. Apple TV is faster than before , snappier than before & runs tvOS which has iOS system as significant amount of about 80% of the tvOS.
Siri makes an appearance on the Apple TV. Faster TV browsing & quick results oriented search.
Apple TV Remote is also upgraded to a touch pad interface on the remote with just less than 5 buttons. Dedicated Siri button for easy accessing between functions.
Games like Asphalt 8 runs buttery smooth using Apple A8 64-bit architecture which makes it possible for such speed improvements.
Apple Remote has sensors like accelerometer & Gyroscope for easy  maneuvering while playing games.
Siri can do stuff right on the television , it is truly a smart TV box which also has next generation Wifi Band AC with MIMO technology.
There is no official update regarding whether it can play 4K content but given the HDMI port which is 1.4 version , even if it supports 4K in future it would be limited to 4k @ 30fps not 60fps which is bummer considering 4K is the future.


Apple WatchOS 2 will finally feature the native applications for Apple Watch & native apps would lead to better control for the developers. One Example of real time monitoring of heart rate data on the Apple watch was showcased in the Apple Keynote.

To wrap it up Apple did release some good hardware this year with better software which works harmoniously with each other using hardware features to its maximum potential.
